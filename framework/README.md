## How to run

1. Making source: You should pass making option to the `./make.sh`
script. Currently, two options are supported, i.e., `gateway` and `executor`. 
For example, if deploying gateway, you should make like `./make.sh gateway`.

2. Runing: Similar to making procedure, you should pass running option to `./start.sh`.
Also, two options `gateway` and `executor` are supported. For example, `./start gateway`.

## Testing
